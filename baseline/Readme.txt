ASVspoof 2019 CHALLENGE:
Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge

http://www.asvspoof.org/


============================================================================================
Matlab implementation of spoofing detection baseline system based on:
  - linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) features + Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
  - constant Q cepstral coefficients (CQCC) features + Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

- GMM
-----------------
VLFeat open source library that implements the GMMs.

- tDCF_v1
----------------
Contains a implementation of the tandem detection cost function, used as the ASVspoof 2019 primary metric. It also contains the Bosaris toolkit.

- ASVspoof2019_baseline_CM.m
----------------
This script implements the baseline countermeasure systems for ASVspoof 2019 Challenge.
Front-ends include LFCC and CQCC features, while back-end is based on GMMs. 
LFCC features use a 20-channel linear filterbank, from which 19 coefficients + 0th, with the static, delta and delta-delta coefficients.
The CQCC is applied with a maximum frequency of fs/2, where fs = 16kHz is the sampling frequency.
The minimum frequency is set to fs/2/2^9 ~15Hz (9 being the number of octaves). 
The number of bins per octave is set to 96. Re-sampling is applied with a sampling period of 16.
CQCC features dimension is set to 29 coefficients + 0th, with the static, delta and delta-delta coefficients.
2-class GMMs are trained on the genuine and spoofed speech utterances of the training dataset, respectively. We use 512-component models, trained with an expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm with random initialisation. The score is computed as the log-likelihood ratio for the test utterance given the natural and the spoofed speech models.

Results are shown in the ASVspoof 2019 Evaluation Plan.
